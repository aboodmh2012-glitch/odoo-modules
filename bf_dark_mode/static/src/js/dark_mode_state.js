 * enough for anything CSS can reach. It is not enough for content living in a
 * shadow root — the chatter renders every email body in one, and a shadow tree
 * ignores the page stylesheet entirely. Those places need to be told, in JS,
 * when the theme flips, hence this shared reactive flag: the systray toggle
 * writes it, the chatter patch subscribes to it.
